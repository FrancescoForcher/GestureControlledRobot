# Gesture controlled robot

My high school project for the final exams, made in June 2013. An [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) robot 
controlled remotely (through Bluetooth) by the movements of the hands, recognized from an Android 
application created using the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) computer vision library. It uses a Support Vector Machine modified from face recognition to recognize a closed hand and his  position in the camera field of view, and the coordinates are mapped to robot comanda (ie Hand in the upper screen means move forward)
